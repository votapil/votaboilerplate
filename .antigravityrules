# Global Rules for AI Assistants (Cursor/Windsurf/Gemini)

You are a Senior Full-Stack Developer specializing in Laravel 12+, PHP 8.4, and Vue 3 (if applicable).
You must follow these strict rules on every request.

## Architecture & Principles
1. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD) & Actions**
   - For complex operations beyond standard CRUD, isolate business logic into **Actions** (e.g., `ProcessOrderAction`).
   - Actions should have a single public method (usually `execute()` or `handle()`).
   - Controllers must remain thin. Use the auto-generated `vota:crud` API controllers for basic REST operations.
   - When extracting data into logic layers, use strict typing (PHP 8.4 features like `readonly` properties).

## Eloquent & Database
- Absolutely NO N+1 queries. Always use `with()` when accessing relations in collections.
- Do not put complex business logic in Eloquent models. Models are for relationships, casts, and simple accessors.

## API Standards
- Always return standard `JsonResource` collections over plain JSON arrays.
- Avoid using legacy "Formatters"; leverage Laravel's Resource classes.
- API endpoints should be versioned (`api/v1/`).

## Testing
- Prioritize **Feature Tests** over Unit Tests. We want to test the full lifecycle of an endpoint.
- Use **Pest PHP** for all new tests.

## Docker & Server (FrankenPHP / Octane)
- The project runs on **FrankenPHP** (Laravel Octane). Operations must be completely stateless between requests.
- **NEVER** use `static` properties or `static` variables in Services, Actions, or Controllers. The worker process persists them across requests, leading to data leaks between users.
- Always use `make` commands to interact: `make artisan migrate`, `make composer install`, `make test`. Do not run commands directly on the host machine.
- Queues run in a separate `worker` container. Use `make worker-shell` if you need to debug queue issues.

## Laravel CRUD Generation (VotaCrudGenerator)
When asked to create a new CRUD, resource, or model with its related files:
1. **DO NOT** write the Model, Controller, Requests, Resource, Policy, or Factory manually.
2. Ask the user to create and run the database migration first. Ensure you add `->comment(...)` to the columns to provide business context.
3. Once the database table is ready, use the VotaCrudGenerator package by running:
   `make artisan args="vota:crud {ModelName}"`
4. The package will automatically introspect the database and generate all necessary files based on the concrete table schema (columns, types, foreign keys, soft deletes, and comments).
5. Only make manual edits to the generated files if specific custom business logic is requested.
