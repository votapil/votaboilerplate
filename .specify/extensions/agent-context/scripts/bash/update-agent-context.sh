# update-agent-context.sh
#
# Refresh the managed Spec Kit section in the coding agent's context file
# (e.g. CLAUDE.md, .github/copilot-instructions.md, AGENTS.md).
#
# Reads `context_file` and `context_markers.{start,end}` from the
# agent-context extension config:
#   .specify/extensions/agent-context/agent-context-config.yml
#
# Usage: update-agent-context.sh [ignored]
#
# TEMPLATE DEVIATION FROM UPSTREAM — deliberate, do not "restore".
# Upstream wrote the path of the most recently modified `specs/*/plan.md` into the
# managed block, so the agent's always-loaded rules file ended up ordering every
# session to read one specific feature's plan. That pointer never expires: after the
# feature merges, every later session — CI repairs, unrelated bug fixes — still starts
# by reading a finished feature's plan as if it were the current context. It also rots
# silently in any rules file the extension does not own (one such file spent 2.5 months
# pointing at a spec directory that no longer existed).
#
# This version writes a STABLE pointer instead: the specs directory and the rule for
# finding the active feature (current branch / most recent spec directory). No feature
# number ever enters the rules file, so the block cannot go stale.
# A `plan_path` argument is still accepted for CLI compatibility and ignored.
