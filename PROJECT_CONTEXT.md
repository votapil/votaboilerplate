# Project Context

This document maintains the high-level memory and current state of the project.
AI Assistants (Antigravity/Windsurf/Cursor) MUST update this document after completing any significant feature, workflow, or bug fix. This serves as a "long-term memory" to prevent context loss across IDE sessions.
