# Project Context

This document maintains the high-level memory and current state of the project.
AI Assistants (Antigravity/Windsurf/Cursor) MUST update this document after completing any significant feature, workflow, or bug fix. This serves as a "long-term memory" to prevent context loss across IDE sessions.

## Project Overview
- **Name**: VotaBoilerplate
- **Stack**: Laravel 12 (FrankenPHP) + Nuxt 3 (Vuetify/Pinia). Admin panel is **Filament PHP v3**.
- **Core Strategy**: Database-First CRUD (`votapil/votacrudgenerator` & `make:filament-resource --generate`), TDD with Pest, and strict DDD/Action-oriented architecture.

## Current Phase
- [x] Initial full-stack scaffolding.
- [x] Advanced AI & DX augmentations (Typescript sync, Scramble, TDD workflows).
- [x] Admin Panel (Filament PHP) integration.
- [ ] Application Core Logic Implementation (Next Step).
